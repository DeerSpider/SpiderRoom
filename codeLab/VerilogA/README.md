# VerilogA
Verilog-A is A continuous time subset of Verilog-AMS.When we use Verilog-AMS to describe the capabilities of the analog simulation domain, we can say that Verilog-A is the same as Verilog-AMS.<p>
Verilog-A/AMS can help you describe analog and mixed signal circuits.It is an alternative to SPICE for writing complex models and also using abstract mathematical formulas to describe precise system functions.
